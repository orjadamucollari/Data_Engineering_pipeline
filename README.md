## Data Engineer project with MYSQL, Python, and AWS

The objective of this project was to accomplish the following steps:

- Data Collection: collect the data through web-scraping or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Data Storage: create a Database (MySQL in my case) and store the gathered data there
- Pipeline to the Cloud: use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to move the pipeline to the cloud
- Pipeline Automation: automate the whole data collection and storage process
